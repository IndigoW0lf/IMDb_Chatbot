    "## Lessons Learned and Future Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this project, I learned the importance of data cleaning and preprocessing, especially when working with text data like movie genres. I also learned how to build a simple interactive chatbot and gained experience with various Python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib. I also practiced using lambda functions.\n",

    "There were challenges along the way, such as ensuring the chatbot can handle various user inputs robustly. I overcame this by carefully considering different possible inputs the user could give and handling each case in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, this project could be expanded in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **More Personalization**: The chatbot could remember users' past preferences to tailor future recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adding More Movie Information**: We could make use of more information in the dataset, such as director, duration, or IMDB rating, to provide more detailed recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **User Feedback**: We could allow users to give feedback on the recommendations, which could be used to further refine the recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Multiple Recommendations**: The chatbot could provide multiple movie recommendations at once, giving the user more choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was a great learning experience and I look forward to applying these lessons in future data science projects.\n"
