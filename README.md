# Movie Recommendation Chatbot

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation Chatbot project! This project implements a simple chatbot that recommends movies based on user-selected genres. It is built using Python and leverages the IMDb dataset to provide movie recommendations.

## Project Overview

The Movie Recommendation Chatbot is designed to interact with users and suggest movies based on their genre preferences. Users can enter a genre, and the chatbot will recommend a random movie from that genre. It also allows users to request a random movie or choose a new genre.

## Project Structure

The project follows this structure:

- `IMDb movies.csv`: The dataset containing information about movies, including genres, titles, stars, and more.
- `Movie Recommendation Chatbot.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the chatbot implementation.
- `README.md`: The README file you are currently reading, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Instructions

To use the Movie Recommendation Chatbot, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies listed in the Jupyter Notebook.
2. Open the `Movie Recommendation Chatbot.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the code cells in the Notebook to load the dataset, define functions, and implement the chatbot.
4. Follow the instructions provided in the Notebook to interact with the chatbot and receive movie recommendations.

## Dependencies

The project has the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas library
- Matplotlib library (for data visualization)

Please ensure that you have these dependencies installed before running the code.
